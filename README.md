# Quiz-Maker By Corey W

Thank you for taking the time to review my quiz-maker project! This was a labor of love.

A few of the conecepts I actively worked to employ:
- LIFT: all files are in an organized structure, easy to locate, identifyable by bext practice file suffixes, flat, and I tried to be as DRY as possible, removing repeat functions, and breaking functions into their most logical directive structure
- Avoided overcomplicating the typescript in favor of traceable variables, models, and function calls that are limitted to only a few lines of code.
- Utilizing third party styling schemes to avoid wasting time re-inventing wheels that take precious time to write out custom css classes.
- Taking advantage of 4+ years experience front end developing, starting with Angular 11

I welcome any feedback in the form of commentary and commits.

##Thanks Again!
